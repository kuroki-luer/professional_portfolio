The following files define the boundary condition for a unipolar pulsed voltage input. Four mode of operations are available, which consist of the following 

**Classical -**
bipolar pulsed input where the voltage amplitude switches to a maximum positive or negative at the moment the voltage input is switch 

**Floored -**
unipolar pulsed input where the voltage amplitude switches from a maximum specified value to 0 when the switching even occurs

**Duty -**
unipolar pulsed input where a duty cycle can be specified. Otherwise it works similarly to the classical mode of operation

**NegativeFloored -**
unipolar pulsed voltage input where the voltage amplitude is negative and it switches from a maximum negative value to 0 when the switching event occurs. A duty cycle needs to be specified

**Bias -**
bipolar pulsed input where a bias is applied to the curve. A duty cycle needs to be specified
